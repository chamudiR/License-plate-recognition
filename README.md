# License plate recognition

This project implements a License Plate Recognition (LPR) system using YOLOv8 on a Raspberry Pi. The system detects license plates in images or video streams and extracts relevant information for further processing.

Features

 - Real-time License Plate Detection: Utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection.

 - Optimized for Raspberry Pi: Designed to run efficiently on low-power hardware.

 - Custom Model Support: Supports loading pre-trained or custom-trained YOLOv8 models.

 - Easy Integration: Outputs detected license plates for use in other applications.

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your Raspberry Pi:

 - Raspberry Pi OS (latest version recommended)

 - Python 3.11 or later

 - pip and venv for virtual environments
